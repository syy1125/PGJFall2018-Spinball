In the not-too-distant future, catastrophe strikes. The Earth destabilizes, rotating slower and slower in its orbit. The world is in chaos. As the days grow longer and the nights stretch on, the natural state of the world falls apart. Resources grow slim, countries are on the brink of war. Brothers and sisters have turned on each other. Economies have crashed and nations have fallen. Despite Science’s best efforts, the Great Deceleration continues. The state of the world has rapidly spiralled out of control.

But there is hope in the darkness. A spark to start the flame of life anew and rekindle the human spirit. When hope was all but lost, a small group of heroes found it- a way to save the world. This new hope…. Is SPINBALL.

The game is simple. Players, called Radians unleash their Quantum Gyroblades into a small arena, attempting to remain in motion as long as possible. 

This new sport takes the stormy world by storm. The small revolution that starts with a single revolution sweeps across the globe. Spread by the intrepid band of heroes, Spinball is anyone’s game. Children gather smooth stones to play at home during the long nights. Young adults stoop in the shade of the ruins to watch the exciting battles. In this time of conflict, friendly competition in Spinball unifies the world under one spiral goal.

This humble sport is not just a pastime, no. While the world loses its rotational energy, the combined spinning of the Radians’ QGB’s fights against the coming end of the world. As players battle to become stronger Radians, the Earth slowly, but surely is gathering its energy once more. 

It’s a slow process, but things start to get better. Some speculate it is just an increasing sense of optimism: Spinball bringing life back into people’s lives. Some say it’s the sense of community they now share for watching Spinball matches. Then, the Unified Time Conference realizes that the Earth’s period has changed by one minute. One minute faster, back to the way it once was. Thanks to the undying fervor of Radians and their fans around the world, the Earth begins to stabilize.

A few years pass, and day and night are still closer to how long they used to be. Sun-scorched plants and light-starved life begins to regrow slightly. Crops yield more and cities rebuild. In these new urban environments, Spinball competitions flourish. The world is alive and full of spinning QGB’s.

Thanks to the altered rotation of the Earth, most calendars are now inaccurate. Scientists have tried to correct the chronology of the days and weeks, but cannot reach a consensus. By approximation and the apparent seasons around the globe, they are piecing together a new monthly calendar. Unexpectedly helpful to this effort is the assumed date of Halloween. Since the days have been stabilizing, people are finding new ways to celebrate old holidays. The days of festivity provide an ideal stage for dramatic Spinball action, but Scientists have noticed an especially high presence of the corrective Spiral Energy of Spinball on Halloween.

For this reason, the fall Spinball season is the most exciting, most dynamic time of the extended year to battle it out. To celebrate, the Spinball Association of Conversion Energy, or SpACE, holds its annual Halloween Tournament: SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL, affectionately referred to as SpOOC by Spinball fans around the world. SpOOC features the same explosives, obstacles, and pyrotechnics of the classic Spinball as the world knows and loves it, but amped up to eleven! 

While Spinball single-handedly saved the world, and still contributes to the stabilization of the Earth’s rotation, there is a dark underworld behind it. To combat the first heroic Radians, a nefarious group calling themselves the X-Axis arose to steal the rotational Spiral Energy generated by Spinball for their own evil plans. The shady organization claimed that they wanted to help humanity move forward. Their plan, however, was to harness the energy to destroy the Earth and use its remains to create a new world that they would control. The X-Axis was thought to have disbanded when the first Radians fought them in climactic Spinball battle, but people still murmur of their continued existence even today. 

Inspired by the X-Axis, more sinister Radians use Spinball to exert their will on others. Cheap tactics and illegally modded Quantum Gyroblades are just some of the ways Spinball criminals beat out their competition to amass ill-gained power and authority in their local Spinball rings. 

Small time Spinball crimes are bound to happen, but there are rumors that some Spinball Crimelords hope to reform the X-Axis and take over the world. The Authorities deny any chance of a resurgence of the organization, but people can’t be certain.

Nevertheless, the world at large enjoys a mostly peaceful life, living and working in harmony. United by the love for one thing…

SPINBALL

...And now, for the news. This last Saturday, local Spinball enthusiast Brian Jameson completed their SpACE official QGB collection, estimated to be worth upwards of five million Spinbucks. When asked about the current state of Spinball, Jameson responded that they are concerned with the supposed power creep affecting more recent models, but hopeful that more classic designs will make a return in the near future.

In a town in Massacutesetts, Radian Laura “Trickshot” Wong became a hero on Thursday after rescuing a cat from a tree using her signature QGB “Wild Wind”. Attempting to one up her, rival Radian “Rad Ian” Jones tried and spectacularly failed to put the cat back in the tree. Thankfully, the cat was unharmed, though Jones suffered a black eye from the rebound of his QGB “Striker” and a kick to the shins from the cat’s owner.

Hurricane Kain, thought to be contributing to a recent lapse in the stabilization of the Earth, has grown to a category 2. Radians in the lower East Spiral region are working to combat the storm with their QGB’s, and have slowed Kain’s speed, but more Radians are needed. The government has issued a state of emergency and deployed a unit of Radians to aid in the efforts to fight off Kain before it makes complete landfall.

For more 28-hour news, stay tuned.
